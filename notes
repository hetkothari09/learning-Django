DJANGO

1. Django is basically a python framework like FLASK, which allows you to
    create websites while using python at the backend.

2. A basic website is created with the help of the following components:
    HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT

3. Consider a CAR as a website. Then:
    metallic body - HTML
    colors, style - CSS
    Engine, parts - JAVASCRIPT

4. All commands:
    to create a project - django-admin startproject PROJECTNAME
    to start the server - python manage.py runserver (after coming in the project directory)
    to create an app - python manage.py startapp APPNAME (out of the project directory)

5. Steps:
    run all the commands
    create urls.py file in the app directory
    copy the code from project's urls.py to app's urls.py
    refactor all the url paths and their specific destination websites
    create static and templates folder

6. To serve your static folder files when user comes through static/ path add the         below code to settings.py in the project app's directory.

STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")
]
